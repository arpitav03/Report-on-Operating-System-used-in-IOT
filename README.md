# Report-on-Operating-System-used-in-IOT
This report discusses the requirements and types of OS for IOT devices

Why choose the right IOT OS?
1. Ensures efficient management and control of IoT applications:
  ○ An appropriate IoT operating system provides the necessary tools, services, and functionalities to effectively manage & control IoT applications.
  ○ Enables efficient resource allocation, task scheduling, & data processing, leading to optimized performance & responsiveness of IoT devices.
2. Determines compatibility with device capabilities and resource constraints:
  ○ IoT devices come in various forms with different capabilities and resource constraints, such as limited processing power, memory, and energy resources.
  ○ Choosing an IoT OS that is compatible with the specific device characteristics is crucial for the optimal utilization of available resources.
3. Influences communication protocols and security features:
  ○ IoT devices often need to communicate and exchange data with other devices, services, or the cloud.
  ○ The choice of IoT operating system affects the availability and compatibility of communication protocols, such as MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP, which are essential for interoperability and data exchange in IoT ecosystems.
  ○ Additionally, the operating system plays a critical role in providing robust security features and mechanisms to protect IoT devices and data from unauthorized access, ensuring data privacy, integrity, and device authentication.
